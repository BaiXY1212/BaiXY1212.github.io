      <h2>Urban Ovens:<br>How Australian Cities Breathe, Burn, and Cool</h2>
      <p>
        On a summer’s day, the streets of Melbourne shimmer while the parks stay surprisingly cool.<br>
        What creates these hidden temperature borders within our cities?<br><br>
        This data story takes you on a journey through ten years of satellite records,
        revealing how urban design quietly shapes the heat we feel — and how nature can help us cool down again.

  <h3>Heatwaves Turn Up the Dial</h3>

  <!-- Opening Context -->
  <div class="text-above">
    <p>
      <b>Australia is heating up faster than ever.</b><br>
      With extreme heatwaves striking more often, urban surfaces across the nation absorb and radiate unprecedented warmth.
      This section visualises the surface temperature response of Australia’s seven major capitals — showing how ordinary warmth transforms into severe heat stress,
      revealing the growing thermal vulnerability of our urban cores when the weather turns extreme.
    </p>

    <p><b>How to Explore</b><br>
      • Toggle between <b>Normal</b> and <b>Extreme</b> to reveal how heatwaves reshape each city’s surface temperature pattern.<br>
      • Click a city on the <b>Dumbbell chart</b> to focus on its local profile — this action also updates all subsequent visuals across the story.<br>
      • You can also change the city anytime using the global selector in the top-right corner.

  <!-- Key Insight & Transition -->
  <div class="text-below">
    <p><b>Key Insight</b><br>
      Switching from Normal to Extreme conditions unveils a striking surge in surface heat.
      The maps make this visible at a glance — cooler tones contract, and hot zones spread outward as the temperature climbs.
      The Dumbbell chart quantifies this escalation: across every capital, the mean land-surface temperature jumps sharply under heatwave conditions.
      Yet the extent of this intensification differs from city to city — a clue that deeper structural forces are shaping the heat we feel.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>What we see here is the symptom</b> — an abrupt spike in urban heat.
      But <b>what causes</b> certain parts of the city to heat so much faster than others?
      The next section digs deeper into the city’s surface itself, analysing how different land-use types and urban forms shape these temperature patterns and drive the intensity of heat build-up.

  <h3>The Anatomy of a Hot City</h3>
  <!-- Opening Context -->
  <div class="text-above">
    <p>
      <b>The anatomy of heat is written in the city itself.</b><br>
      If heatwaves expose our cities’ thermal vulnerability, this section dissects the <i>structures</i> that create it.
      Each urban landscape — from dense commercial grids to suburban sprawl — interacts differently with sunlight, vegetation, and materials.
      By comparing <b>land-use types</b> and their average surface temperatures, we can trace how <i>urban form translates directly into heat</i>.
    </p>

    <p><b>How to Explore</b><br>
      • The city displayed here follows your selection from the Dumbbell chart or global menu above.<br>
      • Hover over a land-use category (on either chart) to see its thermal signature and trigger the linked highlighting.<br>
      • In the Sankey Diagram (right), compare the <b>thickness of the lines</b> — they represent the <b>magnitude of each land-use type's thermal impact</b>, revealing exactly how urban structure contributes to the city's heat zones.

  <!-- Key Insight & Transition -->
  <div class="text-below">
    <p><b>Key Insight</b><br>
      The pattern is clear: <b>built-up zones dominate the city’s heat anatomy</b>.
      Industrial and commercial areas emit the most heat, while vegetated and water surfaces stay comparatively cool — 
      a thermal contrast of more than 10 °C in some cities.
      This difference shows that urban heat is not random; it is <i>engineered</i> by the density, materials, and spatial layout of our built environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet these patterns also reveal opportunity.
      Cities with higher proportions of open or green land — such as Canberra and Darwin — display more balanced thermal profiles,
      suggesting that <b>urban composition itself can moderate heat build-up</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>What if we could harness that balance deliberately?</b><br>
      The next section explores the <i>cooling power of green</i> — showing how vegetation density reshapes surface temperatures
      and offers a path to urban resilience.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- ===== SECTION 3: Cooling Power ===== -->

<section id="section3" class="section cooling">
  <h3>The Cooling Power of Green</h3>

  <!-- Opening Context -->
  <div class="text-above">
    <p>
      <b>If heatwaves reveal our cities’ vulnerability, vegetation shows their capacity to heal.</b><br>
      Having seen how urban form intensifies heat, we now turn to nature — the element that can be designed, planted, and scaled.
      Unlike water bodies, which are largely fixed, green infrastructure is a controllable force in city planning — 
      a living tool to rebalance urban temperature and restore comfort.
    </p>

    <p>
      To understand this power, we trace the relationship between NDVI (vegetation density) and LST (land surface temperature)
      across a decade of satellite records.  
      As greenness rises, temperature falls — a pattern that repeats city after city.  
      Each point on the scatterplot marks a month; each slope tells the same promise: <b>more leaves, less heat</b>.
    </p>

    <p><b>How to Explore</b><br>
      • The city displayed here follows your selection from the Dumbbell chart or global menu above.<br>
      • The left chart visualises the correlation between NDVI (greenness) and LST (surface temperature) for each city.<br>
      • The right chart animates this balance through time, showing how drought, development, or re-greening reshape each city’s thermal rhythm.<br>
      • Use the Play button or slider to follow how vegetation loss and recovery bend the temperature curve decade by decade.

  <!-- Key Insight & Strategic Outlook -->
  <div class="text-below">
    <p><b>Key Insight</b><br>
      The data speak softly but clearly — <b> where vegetation thrives, surface heat retreats</b>.
      Within each city, NDVI and LST move in opposite directions:
      where vegetation thrives, surface heat retreats.  
      This cooling effect extends beyond parks into surrounding suburbs, 
      proving that urban greenery is not cosmetic, but systemic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yearly patterns reinforce this: cities investing in green corridors — like Canberra or Darwin — 
      show milder peaks in surface temperature, while those with dense urban infill face steeper climbs.
      The thermal rhythm of a city is not destiny — it is design.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Strategic Outlook</b><br>
      Cooling is no longer just a climate goal — it’s a planning choice.
      When streets are shaded, courtyards greened, and rooftops revived, the city’s microclimate transforms.  
      The lesson across all three chapters is simple but urgent:  
      <i>we built the heat, and we can unbuild it — leaf by leaf, block by block.</i>
